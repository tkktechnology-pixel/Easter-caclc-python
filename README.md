Easter Date Calculator — command-line and Tkinter GUI versions using the Meeus/Jones/Butcher algorithm.

README body:

This repository contains two Python implementations of an Easter date calculator, 
both using the Meeus/Jones/Butcher algorithm to accurately compute the date of Western (Gregorian) Easter Sunday for any given year.
Easter.py is a simple command-line version that prompts the user to enter a 4-digit year and prints the result directly to the terminal.
Easter_GUI.py is a graphical desktop application built with Python's built-in Tkinter library. It features a clean, 
Easter-themed interface with a year entry field that enforces 4-digit input, a Calculate button (also triggered by pressing Enter),
a Clear button to reset the field, and an Exit button to close the app.
Requirements: Python 3.10 or higher. No third-party libraries are needed — both files use only the Python standard library.
How to run:

Command-line: python Easter.py
GUI: python Easter_GUI.py
